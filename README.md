# Dynamic Time Warp Averaging

Matlab code for computing and comparing three methods for dynamic time warping (DTW) averaging across 3 or more numeric sequences: DTW Barycenter Averaging, Majorize-Minimize and Stochastic Subgradient Descent. In addition to general computation and visualization functions for DTWA, this repository contains control sequence data ("rna_controls"), helper scripts to generate the formatted input data ("utilities") from empirical experiments ("SquiggleStreamSource_FAST5_Files"), and figures for a manuscript under revision at PLoS Computational Biology for the comparison of DTWA methods in the relatively explored context of high information entropy signals such as those generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies direct RNA sequencing.
